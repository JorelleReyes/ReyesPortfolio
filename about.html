            <h1>Hi, I'm Jorelle</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                In my free time, I work on various electronics projects, including hand-wired mechanical keyboards,<br>DIY electronic circuits, and audio systems, among others.
                Im currently pursuing <br>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) at Mapúa University, where I also have an interest<br>in computer programming, 3D animation, video editing, photo editing, and much more.<br>
                Over the years, I've gained experience in repairing gadgets like computers and smartphones.<br>My curiosity started at age 13, when I began taking things apart to see how they worked inside.

            <p>
                This hands-on exploration has given me a solid understanding of how both electronic and<br>mechanical devices function, and Im always fascinated by the inner workings of things.<br>
                For example, when I see a car, I often imagine its internal mechanics—the movement of pistons<br>in the engine, how the transmission gears work in tandem to propel the vehicle, and so on.

                I also have a deep passion for music. I enjoy listening to a wide range of genres and play several<br>instruments, including bass guitar, electric guitar, drums, and ukulele.
                Music is a big part of<br>my life—it helps me organize my thoughts and influences my mood. Whether Im listening to upbeat tunes<br>when Im happy or energizing electronic music to power through tasks, it always has a positive effect on me.
